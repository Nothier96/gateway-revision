      <h2>Majorelle Gardens</h2>
      <p>
        These lush tropical gardens full of cacti, palms, and ferns, are the work of painter Jacques Majorelle.

Originally from the town of Nancy in France, Majorelle came to Marrakesh for health reasons and became well known for his paintings of local Moroccan life.

His most famous work, though, was this garden and the vibrant blue (the color now known as Majorelle blue) painter's studio he lived in on the grounds.

    <h2>Hot-Air Balloon Ride Over the Countryside</h2> 
      <p>
        Several companies run sunrise hot-air balloon ride tours in Marrakesh, which provide panoramic views across the city, the palm groves, and surrounding arid plateau and the spine of the Atlas Mountains in the distance beyond.

For photographers, the dramatic vistas are definitely worth the early-morning start.

      <h2>Cycle or Horse Ride in the Palmeraie</h2>
      <p>
        Marrakesh's Palmeraie (palm groves) area is just to the northwest of the city.

Containing around 50,000 date palm trees, the palmeraie is an alternative to staying in central Marrakesh, with plenty of villa-style luxury boutique hotels.

If you are not staying in the palmeraie, though, you can still enjoy a time-out from the city in this tranquil, shady haven as it's a popular destination for cycling, horse riding, and quad-bike tours, as well as camel rides.

       <h2> Admire the Interiors of Marrakesh Museum</h2>
       <p>The Marrakesh Museum (Musee de Marrakech) has an eclectic collection ranging from contemporary art to Qur'anic inscriptions, with local ceramic work, textiles, and coins thrown in for good measure.

For most visitors, the real highlight of a visit here, though, is the building itself.

The museum is housed in the Mnebhi Palace, which was originally the residence of Mehdi Mnebhi (a minister in Morocco's government) but was later home to Pasha Thami Glaoui, ruler of Marrakesh.</p>

       <h2> Picnic in Manara Gardens</h2>
       <p>This huge garden, once a royal retreat, is a bubble of serenity hidden right in the heart of Marrakesh. It's a favorite spot for locals who want to escape the hustle and enjoy some peace and quiet.

The majority of the area is taken up with olive groves, but for visitors, the main attraction and reason to come here is the large reflective pool with its fine pavilion. Built in the late 19th century, the pool and pavilion are a favored spot for many local Marrakesh families, who come here to picnic and stroll.</p>

       <h2> The Saadian Tombs</h2>
       <p>This 16th-century burial ground is home to 66 members of the Saadian dynasty, which ruled over Marrakesh between 1524 and 1668.

The tombs here include that of the ruler Al-Mansour, his successors, and their closest family members.

It's a rambling, atmospheric place, with the mausoleums set amid a rather overgrown garden.</p>
